# What I do
## Navbar: 
A navbar on my website name on the left side & 5 menu
items in the middle: Home, All Books Listed Books, and Pages to Read, Buy and two
buttons named “Sign In” and “Sign Up”.I apply the Active route on the navbar and the
navbar will be displayed on all pages.
## Banner: 
I make banner section with title and a button Named “View The
List” below the title on the left side. On the right side added an image.
## Books Card:
This section contains 6 cards of books, which are
arranged according to Figma.
Each card will contain-
- image
- tags
- bookName
- author
- category
- rating

## Book Details Page:
This section take dynamic route. The Book details page covers the following data:
- image at the left side of the page
- bookName
- author
- category
- review
- tags
- totalPages
- publisher
- yearOfPublishing
- rating
- And 2 button named - Read, Wishlist

## Listed Books Page design overview:
- You can see a header on the top of this page with a BOOKS title.
- A drop-down
- The Listed Books Page will show you all the read and wishlist books you
have added to the local storage.
- I implement Tab for showing the read books list and
wishlist books list separately.

## Sorry! I forget to tell you the "List books card" holds the following information:
- Name of the book
- Name of the author
- category
- Tags
- Total pages
- Name of publisher
- Publishing year
- And overall rating

## Pages to Read Page: 
I have created a Pages to Read page where I have to
implement a Custom Shape Bar Chart. 
The bar chart shows read-list book's name against 
total pages of read-listed
books.
## Buy Page:
Not 100% but this page was created according to _Daraz_.
##  404 Page: 
_Finally_ I make a 404 page when users do not find the actual page.

# Functionality 

- When clicked "Read" or "Wishlist" for the first time will show a message. The clicked item will be added to the local
storage.
- If users click the same button again for the same book, you'll see warning.
- Once user select a book in the “Read” button then user can not select it using
the “Wishlist” button for further.
- And many more.
